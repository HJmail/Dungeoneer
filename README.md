# Dungeoneer
A Java based game project demonstrating OOP concepts and team based development with YouTrack and GitHub.

Team member names:
- Cristian Acevedo Villasana
- Skyler Broussard
- Hiba Jmaileh

Issues encountered:
- Navigating youtrack and creating user stories, it was a bit confusing to figure out how to move user stories across columns in the Agile board. Some cards didnâ€™t show up or update as expected.
